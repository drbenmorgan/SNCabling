  \noindent This document presents the cable labelling convention used
  for  the SuperNEMO  Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage  System
  (CaloHV).  We reuse  here some informations available  from a couple
  of documents prepared  by Cedric, Mathieu, Christian  with some adaptations
  and addons.

\section{Principle}

The SuperNEMO Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage System (CaloHV)
uses two CAEN High  Voltage crates which host a total  of 24 boards to
distribute HV to 712 PMTs.

Each HV board manages up to 32 channels and is connected to a specific
set of  PMTs through  a pair  of harnesses.   A first  harness, called
\emph{external  harness},  links the  board  (Radial  connector) to  a
single  connector  (Redel  S  Male)   on  the  patch  panel  (external
side). From the  internal face of the patch panel  (Redel S Female), a
new harness, namely the  \emph{internal harness}, routes individual HV
cables  to  the PMTs.   The  end  of  the \emph{internal  harness}  is
designed in  such a  way cables  can be  routed individually  to their
associated PMTs  by splitting in two  wires (HV and ground).   A given
harness aggregates  a set of  cables for PMTs that  are geographically
close to each other, in order to optimize the length of the cables.

In the present  scheme, it has been decided to  identify individual HV
distribution cables using the pin identifiers on the Radial connectors
they are  associated to on  each HV board.  The  pin number on  the HV
board output connector  thus identifies the cable linked  to it.  This
identifier  is  propagated  to  the  pin number  on  the  patch  panel
connectors  then to  the end  of the  cable linked  to the  PMT.  This
enables to build rather simple and comprehensible cabling tables.

\noindent\par Figure \ref{fig:calohv:principle:1}  shows the principle
of the calorimeter  HV distribution.  A dedicated  labelling system is
used to ease the cabling operations (see next sections).
