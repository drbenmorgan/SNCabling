  for  the SuperNEMO  Demonstrator's Calorimeter Signal Readout  System
  (CaloSignal).  We reuse  here some informations available  from a couple
  of documents prepared  by Cedric and Mathieu, SNDER,  with some adaptations,
  fixes and addons.

\section{Principle}

The  SuperNEMO   Demonstrator's  Calorimeter  Signal   Readout  System
(CaloSignal)  uses three  crates which  host a  total of  52 front-end
boards to collect signals from 712 PMTs.

Each front end board  manages up to 16 channels and  is connected to a
specific set  of PMTs through a  pair of harnesses.  A  first harness,
called \emph{external harness},  groups a set of  signal cables linked
to the Wavecatcher front-end board  through MCX male connectors and to
the  patch panel  (external side)  also through  MCX male  connectors.
From  the internal side  of patch panel, a
new  harness,  namely  the \emph{internal  harness},  routes  internal
signal cables to  the PMTs.  Both ends of  the \emph{internal harness}
are designed in  such  a  way internal  signal  cables  can be  connected
individually from  the patch  panel to their  associated PMTs.  On the
patch panel  side, an  internal signal  cable is  equipped with  a MCX
female  connector.  On  the  PMT  side, an  internal  signal cable  is
equipped with  a Souriau pin.  A  given harness handles a  set of PMTs
that are geographically close to each  other, in order to optimize the
length of the cables.

In  the present  scheme, it  has been  decided to  identify individual
signal cables within a harness  using a unique cable identifier.  This
identifier is  propagated through the  patch panel  to the end  of the
cable  linked to  the PMT.   This scheme  implies to  use a  dedicated
cabling table.

\noindent\par Figure \ref{fig:calosignal:principle:1}  shows the basic
diagram of the CaloSignal system. A dedicated labelling system is used
to ease the cabling operations (see next sections).
